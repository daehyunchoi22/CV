					<h2>Interface Dynamics</h2>
				</header>
				<p> Understanding the behavior and mechanism of the mass and momentum transfer through the fluidic
					interface is important to predict the global flow feature such as droplet size/velocity distribution
					in spray generation and fluidic mixing in bubbly flows. However, most previous studies have been
					limited on the canonical flows to enable the theoretical and numerical approach due to the
					presence of complex interfacial instabilies (e.g.
					Rayleigh-Taylor and Shear instabilities) and turbulence as well as lack of measurements with
					sufficient spatio-temporal resolution. To overcome this, I have designed the optimized experimental
					setup
					which can provide suffucient information for validating proposed theoretical hypothesis and,
					thereby, determining dominating interfacial mechanism in complicated interfacial problem, and I have
					developed novel flow measurement using CNN-based optical flow algorithm, which is non-invasive and
					has super spatio-temporal resolution . </p>

									Bubble velocimetry using the conventional and CNN-based optical flow algorithms

						</p>
						<p> We first quantify the bubble velocity with extreme bubble density upto 58% (maximum 11% for
							previous
							studies) by finetuning the CNN-based optical flow algorithm with the generated synthetic
							bubble dataset. Comparing with the conventional technique (PTV) as well as
							the classic optical flow algorithms such as Lucas-Kanade and Farnebäck method, the
							CNN-based model outperforms for all bubble densities in terms of accuracy and time cost.

									Analysis of the liquid column atomization by annular dual-nozzle gas jet flow
								</a>

								<i>(Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 2022)</i>
							</strong>
						</p>
						<p>The liquid atomization of the water column by two annualr gas jets (Reynolds
							number∼<i>O</i>(100,000) is investigated experimentally, depending on the nozzle
							geometry, the momentum flux ratio between jets. Through high-speed imaging
							visualization and PIV, we found that the liquid column is mainly differentiated through
							Rayleigh-Taylor instability
							and its corresponding wavelength accurately predicts the final droplet diameter. Also, the
							appearance conditions of four flow regimes are
							theoretically derived and validated using control volume analysis. </p>

							<strong> Development of the physical-based model on the film thickness and the

							<br>
							<i>Collaborated with <strong>Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (2022)</i>
							</strong>
						</p>
						<p>The end-to-end physical-based model is developed to estimate the film thickness and width
							depending on the fluid (e.g. viscosity and density) and work condition (i.e. applied
							pressure and gun speed). Each process of paint spray is modelled by thecontrol
							volume analysis (for membrane formation), similarity analysis (for spray development), and
							drop-impingement
							theory (for film formation) and validated with the numerical and experimental data.

							<strong> The wake characteristics of partially-superhydrophobic circular cylinder</strong>

							<i>Collaborated with <strong>Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (2016)</i>
							</strong>
						</p>
						<p> Using water tunnel, the effect of the superhydrophobic (SHPo) surface on the cylinder wake
							is studied experimentally. The time-varying condition of surface's wettability is captured
							using high-speed imaging. Through PIV measurement, it is found the SPHo coating with the optimal
							condition reduces the recirculation length of the wake by augmenting the flow fluctuation
							near the region of the flow separation.
